    "Abstract\n",
    "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept in development; is a technological revolution that represents the evolution of computing and aims to establish an interaction between smart objects via the Internet.\n",
    "It is, in short, the possibility of communication between all objects that exist – sending and receiving data and information in order to facilitate people's lives.\n",
    "Internet of Things (IoT) means a great impact for business because it changes the types of devices that connect into a company’s systems. These newly connected devices will produce new types of data. The Internet of Things will help a business gain efficiencies, harness intelligence from a wide range of equipment, improve operations and increase customer satisfaction. IoT will also have a profound impact on people’s lives. It will improve public safety, transportation and healthcare with better information and faster communications of this information. While there are many ways that the Internet of Things could impact society and business, there are at least three major benefits of IOT that will impact every business, which include:  communication, control and cost savings. \n",

    "1.\tIntroduction\n",
    "The internet of things is the next Internet revolution, due to the advancement of wireless technology and the number of sensors (objects) increasing installed worldwide, making it possible to increase the capacity to collect, analyze, distribute and store data. \n",
    "Companies are investing massively in infrastructure the Internet of things and business opportunities are huge in terms of improving productivity and control of the supply and processing chains. Among the investments they are cloud computing, delivering the infrastructure necessary for the functioning of the Internet of Things and the adoption of the devices and the IPv6 protocol that is fundamental to identify the devices on the Internet.\n",
    "The impact on the corporate environment is huge because the data collected by these sensors will help in decision making by managers making the most dynamic world and its faster development resulting in a more competitive and productive market.\n",
    "The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 What is Internet of Things?. Section 3 The Cloud Computing and Internet of Things. Section 4 The Internet of Things and the Economy. Section 5 IPv6 Address of the Internet of Things. Section 6 Security. Section 7 Impact on Enterprise Environment, and Section 8 Conclusion.\n",
    "2.\tWhat is Internet of Things?\n",
    "In the early 2000’s, Kevin Ashton was laying the groundwork for what would become the Internet of Things (IoT) the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Ashton was one of the pioneers who conceived this notion as he searched for ways that Proctor & Gamble could improve its business by linking RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) information to the Internet. The concept was simple but powerful. If all objects in daily life were equipped with identifiers and wireless connectivity, these objects could be communicate with each other and be managed by computers (Lopez, 2013). \n",
    "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept in development; is a technological revolution that represents the evolution of computing and aims to establish an interaction between smart objects via the Internet.\n",
    "It is, in short, the possibility of communication between all objects that exist – sending and receiving data and information in order to facilitate people's lives (Silva et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tThe Cloud Computing and Internet of Things\n",
    "The worldwide cloud computing market grew 28% to $110 billion in revenues in 2015. Synergy Research Group found that public Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) services attained the highest growth rate of 51%, followed by private & hybrid cloud infrastructure services at 45%. The following graphic, figure 1, compares cloud growth by segment and market leaders (Columbus, 2016).\n",
    " \n",
    "Figure 1. Cloud computing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, spending on public cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hardware and software is forecast to reach $38 billion, growing to $173 billion in 2026. Service as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) of cloud hardware and infrastructure software spending are projected to reach $12 billion in 2016, growing to $55 billion in 2026. The following graphic, figure 2, provides an overview of spending on public cloud infrastructure worldwide from 2015 to 2026 (Columbus, 2016).\n",
    " \n",
    "Figure 2. Overview of spending on public cloud infrastructure worldwide\n",
    "\n",
    "The global Internet of Things (IoT) market is projected to nearly double in size between 2014 and 2017, passing the one trillion U.S. dollars mark by that year. By 2019, the global IoT market is forecast to be valued at more than 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars, with the number of connected devices worldwide forecast to reach 42.1 billion in the same year. Since 2012, connected cities, cities or hubs that use information, communication technology and connectivity to address urban problems, are the most important IoT subsystems.\n",
    "The consumer electronics industry is the largest IoT market, with projection to increase its value from 1.15 trillion U.S. dollars in 2014 to over 2.2 trillion U.S. dollars by 2020. Another promising segment is the automotive industry, which is also expected to double its market value in the same time span. As of May 2015, companies of the automotive sector spent an average of 93.51 million U.S. dollars on Internet of Things; this amount corresponds to 0.35 percent of companies’ revenues from this sector. Other industries have higher IoT expenditure in comparison to the automobile industry, which is ranked sixth in average spending. The travel, transportation and hospitality sector has the highest investment amongst selected industries. The companies in this particular sector invest 0.6 percent of their revenue on IoT, which rounds up to 128.87 million U.S. dollars (Statistics, 2016). The following graphic, figure 3, Market Value in billion US dollars.\n",

    "4.\tThe Internet of Things and the Economy\n",
    "The increasing availability of high-quality data collected and transmitted in real-time through cheap, ubiquitous hardware and connections will undoubtedly lead to scientific, technical, and commercial innovation. Industry is currently investing a huge amount in IoT infrastructure, and the opportunities for business are massive in terms of improvements in productivity, and control of supply chains and distributed real-time processing. The IoT is a dynamic world, and the technology is likely to develop faster than the regulation there is a real sense that industry is moving forward and ‘working it out’ as it goes. But how much do we know about the potential of these technologies to support business competitiveness and success? What is the expected economic benefit? And how will it change the workplace?\n",
    "To understand the IoT’s impact on business as well as on the larger society it is useful to focus on the capacity of IoT applications to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tInformate, for example, by gathering information through sensors, to\n",
    "2.\tAutomate and prescribe activities, for example by allocating a function to a system or by supervising the fulfillment of an activity, and to \n",
    "3.\tTransform activities, for example by redesigning a business process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As IoT applications become widely used we need to understand how they interact with organizations and people, and how their actions are variously enabled or constrained. Sensor-gathered data may enable informed decision-making by managers, but automated checks might also constrain a person’s freedom to act differently. Of course, in real-world settings, people may use a technology differently than intended, may influence its capacities by changing it, or not use it at all (BCS, 2013).\n",
    "5.\tIPv6 Address of the Internet of Things\n",
    "Many discussions of the Internet of Things (IoT) appear to assume that IP address space is an unlimited resource that will scale as the IoT scales to previously unimagined proportions. But the IP address space is not unlimited. In fact, the IPv4 address space has been depleted since February 2011. And that could have been the single best reason to consider IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) for the future of IoT. Research has demonstrated that many other reasons exist as well.\n",
    "The IPv6 represents the next iteration of IPv4, which has provided just 232 Internet addresses or about 4.3 billion addresses, which were largely exhausted by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) by Feb. 1, 2011. In contrast, IPv6 enables 2128 IP addresses equivalent to 3.4 x 1038 addresses or 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses enough, arguably, for generations to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability is but one factor in IPv6’s favor. IPv6’s manageability, end-to-end connectivity, as well as its current rate of uptake are also encouraging. In terms of manageability, IPv6 can be compressed into a couple of bytes by using 6LoWPAN  translation, an advantage over IPv4, and this enables its use in low-power sensors that may proliferate in IoT deployment scenarios. In terms of connectivity, two end points anywhere in the world can communicate via IPv6 with the properties of a virtual private network (VPN).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of uptake, leading wireless telecom operators in the United States have been the first to adopt IPv6, based on the need to serve a vast and increasing number of mobile devices. And major web services and online applications, such as Google, YouTube, Netflix and LinkedIn have adopted IPv6 to handle massive global traffic between IP addresses. Internet Service Providers’ choke hold on the \"last mile,\" however, remains an impediment to a highly functional IoT. Figure 4 shows the adoption curve for global IPv6 traffic on Google servers describes the proverbial \"hockey stick\" IPv6 adoption is doubling every nine months. Countries such as Belgium already achieved over 32% IPv6 adoption rate and 52 Million US end-users today use IPv6 to reach Google without even knowing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4. Google IPv6 statistics (Google, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the proprietary protocol approach was built into many if not most enterprises’ business case, so governments, vertical industries, engineers and application developers, among others, had to be persuaded of IPv6’s superior qualities as an enabler of an unfettered IoT and, presumably, resulting market growth. When analyzing the emerging IoT and M2M  related standards, they all tend to converge toward the adoption of IPv6 and its 6LoWPAN compressed version as the reference network protocol. This is the case for 6TiSCH  (IETF), LWM2M  (OMA) and OneM2M . The adoption of IPv6 down to the last miles of IoT deployments is a growing reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of IPv6 to IoT\n",
    "\n",
    "The next logical step from networks of mobile devices to networks of communicating \"Things\" is IoT. That next step will mirror the sequence of events experienced by mobile networks. Proprietary protocols came first, because an individual company’s profits often come before consideration of the common good. But the use of IP and transparency (i.e., open source protocols) is fundamental to IoT development, just as the ease of use and the invisibility of the technology is important to end users. In literature, the value of transparency and ease-of-use, and even more importantly the need for interoperability, will favor IPv6 adoption by the Internet of Things market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific aspects of IPv6 that will propel its use for IoT include, among others:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tScalability\n",
    "\tGrowing global adoption and product availability\n",
    "\tOvercoming Network Address Translation (NAT) limitations\n",
    "\tIP security enablement\n",
    "\tMobility support\n",
    "\tStateless Address auto-configuration\n",
    "\tRedesign of many features that existed in IPv4 but are greatly improved in IPv6: e.g. multicast, multiple addresses (Ziegler et al., 2015).\n",
    "6.\tSecurity\n",
    "Iot/M2M\n",
    "\n",
    "As the applications of the IoT/M2M affect our daily lives, whether it is in the industrial control, transportation, SmartGrid or healthcare verticals, it becomes imperative to ensure a secure IoT/M2M system. With continued adoption of IP networks, IoT/M2M applications have already become a target for attacks that will continue to grow in both magnitude and sophistication. The scale and context of the IoT/M2M make it a compelling target for those who would do harm to companies, organizations, nations, and more importantly people. The targets are abundant and cover many different industry segments. The potential impact could span from minor irritant to grave and significant damage to the infrastructure and loss of life.\n",
    "Although the threats in the IoT environment might be similar to those in the traditional IT environments, the overall impact could be significantly different. That is why there are several efforts in the community to focus on threat analysis[4] and risk assessments to gauge the impact if a security incident or a breach occurs\n",
    "One of the fundamental elements in securing an IoT infrastructure is around device identity and mechanisms to authenticate it. As mentioned earlier, many IOT devices may not have the required compute power, memory or storage to support the current authentication protocols. Today's strong encryption and authentication schemes are based on cryptographic suites such as Advanced Encryption Suite (AES) for confidential data transport, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) for digital signatures and key transport and Diffie-Hellman (DH) for key negotiations and management. While the protocols are robust, they require high compute platform Ñ a resource that may not exist in all IoT-attached devices. Consequently, authentication and authorization will require appropriate re-engineering to accommodate our new IoT connected world.\n",
    "Secondly, these authentication and authorization protocols also require a degree of user-intervention in terms of configuration and provisioning. However, many IoT devices will have limited access, thus requiring initial configuration to be protected from tampering, theft and other forms of compromise throughout its usable life, which in many cases could be years.\n",
    "In order to overcome these issues, new authentication schemes that can be built using the experience of today's strong encryption/authentication algorithms are required. The good news is that new technologies and algorithms are being worked on. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently chosen the compact SHA-3 as the new algorithm for the so-called \"embedded\" or smart devices that connect to electronic networks but are not themselves full-fledged computers[5].\n",
    "Other elements in security that could be considered include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tApplication of geographic location and privacy levels to data\n",
    "\tStrong identities\n",
    "\tStrengthening of other network-centric methods such as the Domain Name System (DNS) with DNSSEC and the DHCP to prevent attacks\n",
    "\tAdoption of other protocols that are more tolerant to delay or transient connectivity (such as Delay Tolerant Networks)( Google, 2016).\n",
    "Many of the security considerations for IoT protocols rely on encryption. As new workflows emerge for sensors and elements connected to the Internet, a disparity in time horizons creates an additional gap: devices might outlive the encryption effectiveness. For example, a power meter in a home may last fifty years, where as the encryption protocol might survive half of that time before it is compromised.\n",
    "Lastly, the communication and the data transport channels should be secured to allow devices to send and collect data to and from the agents and the data collection systems. While not all IoT endpoints may have bi-directional communications, leveraging SMS (automatically or via a network administrator) allows secure communication with the device when an action needs to be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Preservation of privacy has been a concern since the dawn of the Internet. IoT will exacerbate the problem because many applications generate traceable signatures of the location and behavior of the individuals. Privacy issues are particularly relevant in healthcare, and there are many interesting healthcare applications that fall within the realm of IoT. We can cite among others the tracking of medical equipment in a hospital, the monitoring of vital statistics for patients at home or in an assisted living facility. In this environment, it is essential to verify device ownership and the owner's identity while decoupling the device from the owner. Shadowing is a mechanism that has been proposed to achieve this. In essence, digital shadows enable the user's objects to act on her behalf, storing just a virtual identity that contains information about her attributes.\n",
    "Identity management in the IoT may offer new opportunities to increase security by combining diverse authentication methods for humans and machines. For example, bio-identification combined with an object within the personal network could be used to open a door.\n",
    "Privacy and compliance are intertwined and are under the purview of country regulation. As the technology is evolving so quickly, the consumer must be cognizant of how these issues apply to his or her daily life (Frahim et al.2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tImpact on Enterprise Environment\n",
    "Internet of Things (IoT) means a great impact for business because it changes the types of devices that connect into a company’s systems. These newly connected devices will produce new types of data. The Internet of Things will help a business gain efficiencies, harness intelligence from a wide range of equipment, improve operations and increase customer satisfaction. IoT will also have a profound impact on people’s lives. It will improve public safety, transportation and healthcare with better information and faster communications of this information. While there are many ways that the Internet of Things could impact society and business, there are at least three major benefits of IOT that will impact every business, which include:  communication, control and cost savings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Three Cs of IoT\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication. IoT communicates information to people and systems, such as state and health of equipment (e.g.it’s on or off, charged, full or empty) and data from sensors that can monitor a person’s vital signs. In most cases, we didn’t have access to this information before or it was collected manually and infrequently. For example, an IOT-enabled HVAC system can report if its air filter is clean and functioning properly. Almost every company has a class of assets it could track. GPS-enabled assets can communicate their current location and movement. Location is important for items that move, such as trucks, but it’s also applicable for locating items and people within an organization. In the healthcare industry, IoT can help a hospital track the location of everything from wheelchairs to cardiac defibrillators to surgeons. In the transportation industry, a business can deliver real-time tracking and condition of parcels and pallets. For example, Maersk can use sensors to track the location of a refrigerated shipping container and its current temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control and Automation. In a connected world, a business will have visibility into a device’s condition. In many cases, a business or consumer will also be able to remotely control a device. For example, a business can remotely turn on or shut down a specific piece of equipment or adjust the temperature in a climate-controlled environment. Meanwhile, a consumer can use IoT to unlock their car or start the washing machine. Once a performance baseline has been established, a process can send alerts for anomalies and possibly deliver an automated response. For example, if the brake pads on a truck are about to fail, it can prompt the company to take the vehicle out of service and automatically schedule maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Savings. Many companies will adopt IoT to save money. Measurement provides actual performance data and equipment health, instead of just estimates. Businesses, particularly industrial companies, lose money when equipment fails. With new sensor information, IoT can help a company save money by minimizing equipment failure and allowing the business to perform planned maintenance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors can also measuring items, such as driving behavior and speed, to reduce fuel expense and wear and tear on consumables. New smart meters in homes and businesses can also provide data that helps people understand energy consumption and opportunities for cost savings (Lopez, 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tConclusion\n",
    "As we have seen in this article the market designed for the Internet of Things is huge and estimated at trillions of dollars. This is proven by the increasing business investment in infrastructure for the Internet of Things and the impact is considerable in private companies, public companies and population.\n",
    "For the Internet of Things happen it is necessary convergence of various technologies among which wireless networks, the adoption of IPv6, cloud computing, sensor network, with these essential technologies to support the innovations to come.\n",
    "The advantages are numerous, as when a company can collect, analyze, distribute and store data you can plan business strategies and profits providing the best customer service and resulting in the change of the current market.\n",
    "The disadvantages are regarding IPv6 adoption speed and security of information, In the case of IPv6 will need much investment in equipment to \"talk\" Ipv6 is essential and mandatory for the success of the Internet of Things and in the case of security Internet of Things will exacerbate the problem because many applications generate traceable signatures of the location and behavior of the individuals and the privacy that will become increasingly difficult to be preserved.\n",
    "We conclude that there will be a great impact on business with the adoption of technology changing the way to work, study and relate to the world. new doors will be opened in the industrial field, marketing, academic and professional, which is a new world to be tamed.\n",
